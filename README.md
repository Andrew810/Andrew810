Hey! Im Andrew810. 
I've been doing tech support unofficailly since ive been a young teenager for friends, family, and especially myself.
In the past few years ive been learning to code and gathering certs when i can with my busy schedule as a father. 
I currently know javascript, some basic css, and python. 
Eventually i want to get into AI/Machine learning or cyber security. Just kind of depends where the winds take me but both of those seem pretty interesting.
Im hoping to build up an online presence and start working on and creating some projects to showcase to future employers.
Happy Coding!
